Final project for Web Application I exam


This is the final version of the project I committed for my Web Application exam at Polito, which got me a pretty high score (27/30).
It's a simple single page application, implementing a very simple game of categories: you get a letter and a category, you give as many guesses as possible in one minute.

It's a complete version, with both frontend (made mainly with React.js and Bootstrap frameworks) and backend (a simple node.js server with a sqlite3 DB).

How to install (very simple):
- Clone this repo;
- cd the client folder, and run a simple 'npm install' to install all the dependencies needed;
- do the same with the server folder;
- run the server with a simple 'node index.js' while in the server folder, then launch the app by running 'npm start' in another terminal window (while being in the client folder);
- have fun!

DISCLAIMER: it's not a perfect project, it was made for didactical purposes, it has a few flaws ant lots of stuff that could be surely improved. If you want to try it out, and then work on it on your own to improve it, feel free to do so!
